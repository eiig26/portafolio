With a strong foundation in geospatial sciences and advanced data analytics, I have developed a comprehensive portfolio that highlights my technical expertise, research experience, and dedication to innovative solutions in spatial data analysis and computational social science. I'm studying a Master’s degree in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, complementing my earlier Master’s in Geographic Information Systems and Bachelor’s in Geomatics Engineering from universities in Panama.

My professional journey spans over a decade and includes diverse roles such as a Project Engineer at Esri Panama, where I applied GIS tools to support public and private sector projects, and a Project Manager for Panama's National Authority for Government Innovation, overseeing geospatial initiatives to drive informed decision-making within government operations. I have also contributed as a professor at the Technological University of Panama, teaching core GIS and cartography courses and mentoring future professionals in the field.

Currently, as a Tutor Consultant and Research Assistant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I work on data science projects that integrate machine learning and spatial analysis to address real-world challenges. My portfolio showcases a range of applied research, projects, and teaching experiences, reflecting my experience on data and GIS technologies to solve complex problems in urban planning, environmental management, and social science.


## Projects
### From Web Scraping to Machine Learning: Understanding Panama City's Real Estate with Python.
•	Objective: Analyze the real estate market in Panama City using data from ACOBIR's website. Initially web scraping apartment listings, and then exploring the factors influencing property prices through data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.
•	Tools Used: Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Folium, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
•	GitHub Repository: https://github.com/eiig26/realestate_panamacity

### Analysis of Sexual Crime Trends in the Los Angeles: Spatio-Temporal perspective with GIS
Objective: Detect and explore sexual crimes trends in Los Angeles using official LAPD data and ArcGIS Platform to incorporate data transformation and a range of visualizations, including 3D and space-time techniques like the Space Time Cube and Hot Spot Analysis, to study relationships between crime incidents, time, and spatial patterns.
•	Tools Used: ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Notebooks, ArcPy, Python, Spatial Analysis, ArcGIS Online
•	StoryMap: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/6e4a083720b54f8b978e928c78c608c9

### From Data to Decisions: Understanding the Housing Prices determinants in Massachusetts
•	Objective: Examine the impact of various factors on housing prices in Massachusetts using regression models, analyzing house features (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, lot size), location, median household income, population density, and crime index.
•	Tools Used: R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, linear model)
•	GitHub Repository: https://github.com/eiig26/housing_predictions_603
