### From Data to Decisions: Understanding the Housing Prices determinants in Massachusetts
[Github Repository]([https://github.com/eiig26/housing_predictions_603])

This study, "From Data to Decisions: Understanding the Housing Prices Determinants," examines the impact of various factors on housing prices in Massachusetts using linear regression models. I analyzed house features (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, lot size), location, median household income, population density, and crime index. My findings indicate that larger house sizes, more bathrooms, and higher population densities are associated with increased prices, while additional bedrooms and higher crime rates correlate with price declines. Regional disparities reveal that the Central, Northeast, and Southeast regions have notably higher prices compared to the Western region. Median household income is also a significant predictor. This research underscores the diverse factors influencing housing markets and demonstrates strong predictive power with a high R-squared value.
